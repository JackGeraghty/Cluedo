# Cluedo
The classic Cluedo board game re-imagined in a pixel-art theme.

Cluedo was made as part of the Software Engineering II project. Cluedo was made by a team of three. We worked as part of a team with the
work being divided between us so as to meet out sprint deadlines.

## Cluedo, What is it?
Cluedo involves players trying to solve a murder. They do this by moving around the board, entering rooms and asking questions in those rooms.
As questions are asked and replies given, the player must use their notes alongside their brain to try and uncover who the murderer is, what weapon they used to commit it and in what room they did it
. When a question is asked it is up to other players to show their cards and disprove the question asked.

## The Bot Branch
As part of the final sprint of the project we had to made a bot that would play Cluedo and win. The bot was played against all of the other bots in
the year and at the end whoever had the most wins won the Best Bot Competition. 

The bot works by analysing what cards they have, what global cards are available (depending on number of players some cards are made visible to all players) 
, the responses given by other players and their current position on the board. Once it has this information it decides whether it should move towards or a room,
or if it is in room what question it should ask. After it has all the information gathered and it thinks it knows who committed the murder it moves towards the cellar to 
make an accustation.
